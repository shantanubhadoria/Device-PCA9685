=head1 NAME

Device::PCA9685 - I2C interface to PCA9685 16 channel 12 bit PWM Generator

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Device::PWMGenerator::PCA9685;
 
     my $dev = Device::PWMGenerator::PCA9685->new(
         I2CBusDevicePath => '/dev/i2c-1', # this would be '//dev/i2c-dev-0 for Model A Pi
         debug            => 1,
         frequency        => 400, #Hz
     );
     $dev->enable();
     $dev->setChannelPWM(4,0,$dutycycle); # Duty cycle values between 0 and 4096 channel 4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Object oriented interface to Adafruit 16 channel 12 bit
PWM Generator(PCA9685). Before you use this module make sure you follow install
Prerequisites for L<Device::SMBus>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 I2CBusDevicePath

this is the device file path for your I2CBus that the PCA9685 is connected on e.g. /dev/i2c-1
This must be provided during object creation.

=head2 PWMGenerator 

    $self->PWMGenerator->enable();
    $self->PWMGenerator->setChannelPWM($channel,$pulseOnPoint,$pulseOffPoint);

The PCA9685 offers a 12 bit resolution which means across a duty cycle you may set and unset the PWM at 4096 different point. 
Range of values for $pulseOnPoint and $pulseOffPoint is 0 to 4095
Range of values of $channel is 0 to 15
